        <h2>Product Details</h2>
        <p>The frontend product is an interactive website. It offers various learning modes to better match individual user expectations, from standard flashcards viewing, to tetris-like mini-games, which gamify the experience and allow users to study the material by having fun. The website allows users to create their own study content or access other user-generated material via a search tool. The decks can then be modified, shared, exported, deleted and used for studying.</p>
        <p>The app consists of four different learning modes in total. First, a traditional-like flashcard viewing based on real-life use of flashcards. Then, an open-answers quiz, which allows the users to test their familiarity with the material by typing out the definitions. Finally, there are two mini-games designed to engage users in the learning process by making it more enjoyable and fun.</p>
